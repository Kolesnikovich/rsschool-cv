## About me
I have a strong desire to work in the frontend-development sector.
During 3 years of university I managed to try and master the very basics of: JavaScript, PHP, C#, C++, Java.
I am confident in spoken English. I can communicate in it easily (at least by simple correspondence with foreigners or conversations with them in discord on various topics). I took part in the university English Olympiad (according to the results of the Olympiad my English level is B2).
I am pretty fast in assimilating new knowledge, I am motivated to work and work well.
